# Leadro Alegre GitHub Profile
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lea1985 I was born in Rosario Argentina and I am systems engineer. During the last 10 years I was in charge of the administration of an organization in a managerial role but due to the responsibilities and stress I decided to change my work profile.
- 👀 I am interested in getting a new job that allows me to grow in the development area. I want to gain experience in HTML, CSS and Java Script. On the other hand, I want to gain experience in the DAX language because I have had some experience in those technologies during 2020 and both types of areas seem good, interesting and fun to me.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java Script, WordPress, GitHub and Power BI
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in any job that allows me to gain experience in any of the technologies mentioned above.
