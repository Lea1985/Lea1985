# Leadro Alegre GitHub Profile
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lea1985 I was born in Rosario Argentina and I am systems engineer. During the last 10 years I was in charge of the administration of an organization in a managerial role but due to the responsibilities and stress I decided to change my work profile.

- I have been working on different projects since 2020. The pandemic was the perfect excuse to start my journey as a developer.
Since then I have carried out several projects. Manage multiple sites moodle virtual classrooms and I manage them from 2020 to present. 
Also implement a freelace website using WordPress.
These  work experiences were the kick that motivated my interest and passion in Js and PHP.

- 👀 I am interested in getting a new job that allows me to grow in the development area. I want to gain experience in HTML, CSS Js and PHP. 


- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java Script, WordPress, PHP and GitHub.
